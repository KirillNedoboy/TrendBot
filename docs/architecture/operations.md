# Operations baseline

The target deployment is a Linux VPS managed by systemd. Logs are structured JSON sent to journald; health, reconnect, stale-data, rate-limit, persistence, and kill-switch signals become observable in later phases. CI is configured for Windows and Linux through GitHub Actions but has no remote run in this bootstrap.

Docker, Kafka, Kubernetes, and ML are outside V1 scope. Secrets must come from the environment or a secret store and must never enter source, logs, docs, or test fixtures.
